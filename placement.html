          For most students, higher education is a journey that culminates in a
          satisfying career. All of them enter an institution of higher education
          with the objective of finding their 'dream job' at the end of their
          academic campaign. </p>
        <p>The Assam Don Bosco University does everything to
          support this dream of its students. In addition to providing them
          quality education and important life skills, we ensure that our students
          make a smooth transition from academic life to work life through our
          active placement cell. </p>
        <p>To ensure the quality placement of our graduates,
          we’ve established a number of interactive processes that help them make
          the switch from being students to being professionals. These interactive
          processes include</p>

            The Assam Don Bosco University employs an efficient team of career counselors to help students choose their
            line of work. Our counselors work with students to identify their areas of interest, aptitude, personal
            traits
            and
            qualities. Care is taken to ensure they’re placed in fields that cater to their interest and can maximize
            their
            potential. We welcome all our students to avail the career guidance and counseling service.

            <h1>INDUSTRY INTERFACE</h1>
            ADBU’s courses are designed to bridge the gap between academia and employment for its students. As a result,
            we’ve embedded active industry interface in relevant courses. Industry visits, technical discourses and
            career
            seminars are regularly arranged for our students to get a sense of the world they are about to venture into.
            Not only does it help students get invaluable industry experience, it also helps them prepare for their
            future
            careers in keeping with ADBU’s motto of 'Carpe Diem' or 'seize the day'.
